/*
  WHAT IS A NULL POINTER ?
   1 - Null pointer is a pointer which has a value reserved for indicating that the pointer or reference does not refer to a valid object.
   2 - a null is guaranteed to compare unequal to any pointer that points a valid object.
   3 - Dereferencing a null pointer is undefined behavior in c.
   4 - Null pointer gives a functionality to c programmers to check whether a pointer is legitimate or not.
